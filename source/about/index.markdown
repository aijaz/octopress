<!-- ai l /images/aijaz.jpg /images/aijaz.jpg 235 256 Hello! -->
As a hacker by nature, I enjoy making things. I code Perl for a living
and write iOS for fun. I also dabble in woodworking and origami and
making tangible things with my hands. Oh, I've also written a pretty
nifty open-source job scheduler called
[TaskForest](http://www.taskforest.com). 

I'm a student of Wing Chun Kung Fu, having studied at the excellent
[Philip Nearing School of Wing Chun](http://wingchunchicago.com/).  I've
also made a wooden Kung Fu dummy (what a fun project!).  I'll post
pictures of that soon.
