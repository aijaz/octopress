The [#grid](http://hashgrid.com/) website has a great tool for web designers
-it "inserts a layout grid in web pages, allows you to hold it in place, and
toggle between displaying it in the foreground or background."  Go to their
[website](http://hashgrid.com) and have a look.  It's pretty impressive.
Simple, but impressive.  I think I'm gonna give this a shot for the next web
site I design.  I think it would be really useful in development, not as much
in a production environment.
