Jessica Hische has just published [a very well written article](http://www.jessicahische.is/obsessedwiththeinternet/andbeingresponsivelyinspired/inspiration-vs-imitation-2) on "why it's ok to copy people to learn, but
never ok to publish that work."  I love the tone of her writing.  Even though
I'm not a designer and won't ever be as good a letterer as she is, I hope to
be able to write as well as her.
