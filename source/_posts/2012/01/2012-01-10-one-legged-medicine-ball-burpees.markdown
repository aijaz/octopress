After only being able to do a single one-legged medicine ball burpee last week, I was able to do 12 last night.  Here's the trick:

The X2 Core workout of P90X2 is all about core strength and balance.  Having
completed P90X twice, I've found this workout intimidating but not impossible.
The exception is the one-legged medicine ball burpee.  The workout calls for a
single set of 12, but on the first day I was only able to do 1.  

Last night, on the second day of X2 Core I was able to do all 12.  It's not
that I got that much better over 7 days.  The trick was that I stopped and
really watched how the people in the video were doing this exercise.  I was
doing it wrong.  My mistake was that I had the medicine ball at shoulder level
when I was doing a one-legged push-up on it.  This made it very difficult to
balance. 

Simply moving the medicine ball 'down' to solar-plexus level helped immensely.
This way I was more balanced and my arms were perpendicular to the ground, and
I was able to keep my elbows in.  It was still very difficult, but I was able
to hammer out 12 ugly reps.  Now that I understand the form I can work on
perfecting it and working on 12 slow, solid reps.

So, if you're doing P90X2 now, and find one-legged med-ball burpees as
difficult as I did, have another look at your form and make sure you're not
putting the ball to much in front of you, instead of directly under you.
