<div style="float: right">
Whose streets these are I think I know.<br>
<!-- more -->
The brave commuters of Chicago-o;<br>
They wonder why I'm standing here<br>
To watch the streets fill up with snow.<br>
<br>
The hurried folk must think it queer<br>
To stop without a shelter here<br>
Between the Loop and frozen lake<br>
The darkest evening of the year.<br>
<br>
The give my lazy butt a shake<br>
To ask if there is some mistake. <br>
The only other sound's the sweep <br>
Of easy wind and downy flake.<br>
<br>
The Streets are lovely, dark and deep<br>
But I have promises to keep,<br>
And miles to go before I sleep,<br>
And miles to go before I sleep.<br>
<br>
<br>
With apologies to <a href="http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poem/171621">Robert Frost</a>.
