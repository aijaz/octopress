"Cloud Gate" - fondly known as The Bean. Millennium Park, Chicago. Looking
East, half an hour before a sunrise that was hidden behind
clouds.<!-- more --> We originally wanted to get a picture of the sun
rising under the bean, between the two trees (happens on the equinoxes
(equinii?)) but the clouds prevented that and gave us a better shot,
instead.
