As I walked along the Corniche, I saw a huge flock of gulls in one spot in the
lagoon.  On the shore was this man, throwing bread into the water.  I
approached him and asked if I could take a picture of the bread.  "Are you
with a newspaper?" he asked. "No."  "Then it's fine.  No newspapers."  He
turned back to a bench and I saw the huge bag full of bread.  Today the birds
would eat well.

I liked the composition of the picture from this side (below).  The
juxtaposition of the masjid to the man seemed to be more appropriate here.
